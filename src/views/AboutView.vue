    <h1>Made by B路U路T</h1>

    <p>Here's why you should ditch the rusty kitchen timer and join the B路U路T Rise revolution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No more counting sheep:</strong> We'll handle the countdown, you handle the glorious
        blood flow rush to your legs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Silence the nagging guilt:</strong> We'll guilt-trip you for you, with friendly
        (okay, maybe slightly sassy) reminders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Escape the tyranny of the chair:</strong> Set your timer, get those creative juices
        flowing on two feet, and watch your productivity soar.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why trust us?</p>
    <p>Well, for one, we understand the struggle.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We've seen more blurry spreadsheets than a nearsighted accountant.</li>
      <li>Second, we've programmed more timers than a baker has set for rising dough.</li>
      <li>Finally, we truly believe in the power of a good desk break .</li>
    </ul>
